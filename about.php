      <p><strong>Thought Initiating Event</strong> : Saturday night out… Boys reunion… Funny quotes… hilarious comments… Selfie sessions… New photos, old memories… Old Photo Digging… <strong>Error 404… No result found!</strong></p>
      <p>The loss of an all time favorite memory which was believed to be stored digitally ignited the real question. How can the memories be best kept? The importance of photo prints was realized advertently. 
      Digital storage was soon realized to be a boon as well as a curse. Like every technological advance the triumph of digital photography and its devices has left victims, in this case victims were our memories.</p>

      <p>A bunch of friends Ashish, Nitin and Rahul got together to get tested yet again, this time not as friends, but partners. The seeds of inception were sown and <span class="pinktxt">www.printmysnap.com</span> was registered to seek newer and unlike horizons. We want to bring back the art of printing, we want those moments to find a permanent place in our homes, our offices, our life, our inspirations, our thoughts... </p>


      <p>But it wasn’t easy out here to make people understand the real quest and then drive them back again through the era of photo prints. Its importance and meaningfulness had to be spread.</p>

      <p>We started off on a journey where less was known and more was to be learnt. The basic idea behind the concept was a photo print and the ease of getting it done. Printing, paper, technology, durability, quality, finish, sizes, logistics and much more was explored. Out of the numerous options across various factors, we settled for the best and the most satisfactory practices. Processes were drawn, the website was published and the printing has never stopped since.</p>
